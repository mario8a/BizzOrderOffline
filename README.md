# BizzOrder

BizzOrder is an Android application designed to streamline and manage business orders. It allows users to browse products or services, place orders, and potentially track their status. The application is built using modern Android development practices and libraries.

## Key Technologies and Libraries

This project utilizes a modern Android technology stack, including:

*   **Kotlin:** The primary programming language.
*   **Jetpack Compose:** For building the user interface declaratively.
*   **Hilt:** For dependency injection.
*   **Retrofit & Moshi:** For efficient networking and API communication.
*   **Room & Realm:** For local data storage and persistence.
*   **Jetpack Navigation:** For handling in-app navigation between screens.

## Building and Running the Project

To build and run BizzOrder on your local machine, follow these steps:

**Prerequisites:**

*   **Android Studio:** Ensure you have the latest version of Android Studio installed. (Specify version if known, e.g., Iguana or newer)
*   **JDK:** Java Development Kit (JDK) version 11 or higher is required.

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/bizzorder.git # Replace with the actual repository URL
    cd bizzorder
    ```
2.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    *   Open Android Studio.
    *   Select "Open an Existing Project".
    *   Navigate to the cloned `bizzorder` directory and select it.
3.  **Sync Gradle:**
    *   Android Studio should automatically start syncing the Gradle project. If not, click on "Sync Project with Gradle Files" (often a small elephant icon in the toolbar).
4.  **Run the Application:**
    *   Select an emulator or connect a physical Android device.
    *   Click the "Run" button (green play icon) in Android Studio.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Android application structure:

*   `app/src/main/java/com/mario8a/bizzorder/`: Contains the core Kotlin source code for the application.
    *   `BizzOrderApplication.kt`: The main application class.
    *   `MainActivity.kt`: The entry point activity of the application.
    *   `di/`: Dependency injection modules (using Hilt).
    *   `data/`: Data sources (network, local database), repositories.
    *   `domain/`: Business logic, use cases, and domain models.
    *   `presentation/`: UI-related classes, ViewModels, and Composable functions.
    *   `ui/theme/`: Theme definitions for Jetpack Compose.
*   `app/src/main/res/`: Contains all non-code resources.
    *   `drawable/`: Drawable images and icons.
    *   `layout/`: (Traditionally for XML layouts, less used with Compose but might contain specific XML files like `activity_main.xml` if not fully Compose).
    *   `mipmap/`: Launcher icons.
    *   `values/`: String resources, colors, styles, etc.
*   `app/src/androidTest/`: Instrumentation tests.
*   `app/src/test/`: Unit tests.
*   `build.gradle.kts` (Project level) and `app/build.gradle.kts` (App module level): Gradle build scripts for managing dependencies and build configurations.
